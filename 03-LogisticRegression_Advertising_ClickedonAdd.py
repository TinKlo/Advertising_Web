# Logistic Regression Project - Solutions
# 
# In this project the work is done with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement on a company website. This model trys to predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
# 
# This data set contains the features:
# 
# - 'Daily Time Spent on Site': consumer time on site in minutes
# - 'Age': cutomer age in years
# - 'Area Income': Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer
# - 'Daily Internet Usage': Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet
# - 'Ad Topic Line': Headline of the advertisement
# - 'City': City of consumer
# - 'Male': Whether or not consumer was male
# - 'Country': Country of consumer
# - 'Timestamp': Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window
# - 'Clicked on Ad': 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad
